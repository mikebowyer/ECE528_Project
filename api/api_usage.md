# Roadway Event Estimation Based On Dashcam Image APIs
This page describes how to use the different APIs related to the Roadway Event Estimation Based On Dashcam Image project. There are two application programming interfaces:
* Image Upload API - API for users to upload images taken from their dashcams
* Uploaded Image Fetching API - API for users to fetch images uploaded from dashcams meeting GPS, timing, and label criteria

These API allows interaction with the Crowdsourced Data project. The base URL for this project is https://dy0duracgd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev. All methods are defined relative to this base URL.

# Image Upload API
### Purpose of API
The purpose of this API is so users can upload an image to a Crowdsourced database. There is some required added metadata which must be included in the API call. 
### API Parameters
| Parameter Name |                 Parameter Description                  | Parameter Type | Required Parameter |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------: | :------------: | -----------------: |
| Latitude       | Latitude (decimal degrees) where the image was taken.  |    float64     |                Yes |
| Longitude      | Longitude (decimal degrees) where the image was taken. |    float64     |                Yes |
| ImageBase64    |        Image bytes encoded as a base64 string.         |     string     |                Yes |
### Example API Call URL
https://dy0duracgd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/share-image?Latitude=48.3&Longitude=-83.3&ImageBase64=<ImageBase64>

# Uploaded Image Fetching API
## Purpose of API
The purpose of this API is so users can obtain a list of uploaded images from the dashcam database with a provided criteria. The criteria which can be provided is a GPS bounding box, a freshness limit, and a detected label category. This allows users to get images within a certain geographic area, which were taken in a given recent amount of time, and have a particular detected label in them.
